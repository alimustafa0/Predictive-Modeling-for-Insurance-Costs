# Insurance Charge Predictor

Predictive modeling project for estimating insurance charges using decision tree, random forest, and gradient boosting regressor models.

## Overview

This project focuses on building and comparing machine learning models to predict insurance charges based on key factors such as age, sex, BMI, children, smoker status, and region.

## Models

- **Decision Tree:** Simple yet interpretable model for understanding feature importance.
- **Random Forest:** Ensemble model for improved predictive accuracy.
- **Gradient Boosting Regressor:** Boosted model for enhanced precision.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run the Jupyter notebook to explore the data and train the models.

## Results

Evaluate model performance, compare accuracy, and choose the best model for predicting insurance charges.
